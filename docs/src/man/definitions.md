GTPSA allows for explicitly distinguishing between state *variables* and external *parameters*. For example, suppose you have defined the evolution of some initial state ``x_i`` of a dynamical system to a final state ``x_f`` as ``x_f = \mathcal{M}(x_i,k)``, where ``k`` is some external parameter. When ``\mathcal{M}`` is expanded in powers of ``\Delta x_i`` and ``\Delta k``, distinguishing between the state variable ``x`` and parameter ``k`` can significantly simplify analyses of the system.  In the context of `GTPSA.jl`, we refer to ``\mathcal{M}(x_i,k)`` as a *GTPSA map*. The GTPSA map is strictly different from the so-called *differential algebra (DA) map*, whereby the coordinate system follows the zeroth order part so that it is zero at all states. `GTPSA.jl` only provides functionalities for a GTPSA map; the management of the zeroth order part to create a proper DA map is relegated to a separate analysis package.

The difference between a GTPSA map and a DA map can be shown with a simple example.
