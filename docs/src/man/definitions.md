GTPSA allows for explicitly distinguishing between state *variables* and external *parameters*. For example, suppose you have defined the evolution of some initial state ``x_i`` of a dynamical system to a final state ``x_f`` as ``x_f = \mathcal{M}(x_i,k)``, where ``k`` is some external parameter. When ``\mathcal{M}`` is expanded in powers of ``\Delta x_i`` and ``\Delta k``, distinguishing between the state variable ``x`` and parameter ``k`` can significantly simplify analyses of the system.  We refer to ``\mathcal{M}(x_i,k)`` as a *map*.
